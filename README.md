Data Science Pipelines
======================

This repository contains code and configurations for building, deploying, and maintaining data science pipelines. The goal is to enable data engineers and data scientists to easily create reproducible, scalable, and efficient workflows. The project includes support for ETL processes, data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning model training.

## Features

- **Modular Pipeline Design**: Easily plug and play different pipeline components.
- **ETL Processes**: Automated extraction, transformation, and loading scripts.
- **Feature Engineering**: Custom feature transformations for machine learning models.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train models using popular machine learning frameworks and evaluate their performance.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent results with configuration-based pipelines.
- **Testing Suite**: Includes unit tests to validate each pipeline component.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luzbetak/data-science-pipelines.git
   cd data-science-pipelines
   ```

2. **Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the pipelines**:
   Navigate to the `pipelines` directory and run the desired pipeline script. For example:
   ```bash
   python pipelines/run_etl.py
   ```

2. **Jupyter Notebooks**:
   Explore data and develop new features in the `notebooks/` directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/
   ```

3. **Configuration**:
   Adjust configuration files in the `config/` directory to modify pipeline behavior.

## Dependencies
